# Employee Classes

After using C#, mainly ASP.NET, I started playing around with C/C++ and looking
at the execution between dotnet console and the aforementioned C/C++.

I then went down the proverbial 'Rabbit Hole' creating an Employee class, then adding
a Department class. Using VS Code & Vim to edit and GCC on Linux (Debian), I kept
compile errors saying the Employee 'Department' type wasn't recognised.

Trying this on Visual Studio now - Just for leaning & Covid-19 lockdown fun :)
